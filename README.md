# Avoid

This is a personal project I put effort into for some months, it is actually based on the concept of a game I developed in c++, but much more feature-packed and complex. It uses Phaser.js as game engine even though I made a very minimal use of it, just to load assests, manage scenes and manage frames. All the rest is made by me, including the movement system,collision system, and each entity logic and behavior. 
The music is courtesy of Monolith Official Soundtracks and Swngyil YOON.
I also thank my friend [Angelo Lista](https://github.com/AngeloLista) for his help with the HTML and CSS part.
